# Mini-Projects

Basically:  Mini Projects helps you to explore and strengthen the understanding of fundamentals through the practical application of theoretical concepts. It's like a beginner's guide to doing larger projects later on.

I've got a list of many mini projects but here are a few of them:
1. "CLOCK": Displaying Time and saying time each hour using tkinter package and pyttsx3 liberary.
2. "FCAEREC": Face  recognizing using OpenCV and face_recognition liberary.
3. "NOTEPAD": Build a text editor using tkinter package and filedialog module.
4. "SNAKE": Typical snake game with score and highest scores displaying.
