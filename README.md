# Mini-Projects

Basically:  Mini Projects helps you to explore and strengthen the understanding of fundamentals through the practical application of theoretical concepts. It's like a beginner's guide to doing larger projects later on.

I've got a list of many mini projects but here are a few of them:
1. "FACEGRAB": Face Detection and Search - _inprogress_
1. "CLOCK": Displaying Time on your screen and telling you the time after every hour  - _inprogress_
